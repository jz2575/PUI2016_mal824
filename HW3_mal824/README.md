#### Assignment 1

In this assignment, I created five different distributions (randomly generated) with the same mean. I then plotted the distributions to show what happens when the sample size gets larger. The insight here is that as the randomly generated sample size gets larger, the distribution of the sample will start to become a normal distribution regardless of what the initial distribution that we started with.

Citations: I followed Federica's assignment example but defined any parameters by myself as needed. TA Himanshu guided the writing of the code for the final plotting of all distributions. 

#### Assignment 2 - Phase 1

For this assignment, I worked in a group (group members: Alexey Kalinin, Laura Gladson, Nonie Mathur, Santiago) to set up a statistical test using Citibike data. The research question we asked were as follow: Are users under 35 years of age significantly more likely to bike for longer durations than the average user?

We downloaded the Citibike data from an Citibike's website and used pandas to read and wrangle the data for our research needs (dropping irrelevant columns from the data frame). 

Please note that the final portion of my assignment (plotting the distribution of data) differs from my groups because I didn't have time to work with them together. For my assignment, I divided the age data (birth year) into two groups (Under_35 Users and Average_Users) and plotted each group's average trip duration time.

#### Assignment 3:

For assignment 3, we completed a z-statistic test to determine if the average commute time improved after a new bus route was implement. To do this, we set up a null and alternative hypothesis (done in class together) and completed a z-test to see if we can reject the null. 

After we set up the hypothesis, I downloaded the sample data file containing the new commute time data and wrangled it for our analysis. First we had to assign a header to the data since the file was mis-reading the first value as a header. 

Then I found the mean and standard deviation of the sample data and used the given mean and standard deviation of the population data to calculate the z-statistic. 

Citations: I completed this part of the homework with the group from assignment 2 and therefore our codes share similarities.
